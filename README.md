This is my Midwestern Interactive coding challenge fully completed. I have all my js, html, css, and api code posted in here. I have not include the things like assets, node.js modules used, or smaller stuff like that as I figured that stuff was not needed and would just pad down the vital parts, however if those are needed I will edit this repository to include those things.

Additionally i have not put the local mySQL database in here as I used the MySQL workshop to set that up and not actual code, so im not sure how i would put that in this repository, however if that is also needed in here I can figure out how to get that to you.

Thanks again for giving me this challenge and I hope that I didn't dissappoint!
